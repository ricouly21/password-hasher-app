# Password Hasher App

A simple app that lets you generate an encrypted text (e.g. passwords). It uses a crypto algorithm,
together with a random salt string and a custom pepper string.

This app uses SHA-512 by default. You can change the crypto algorithm and the pepper value on the .env file.

## Installation
Run these commands to run the app:
```
cp .env.bak .env
npm install
npm start
```
